Storybook is theme-able!

## Global theming

It's possible to theme Storybook globally.

We've created two basic themes that look good out of the box: "normal" (a light theme) and "dark" (a dark theme). Unless you've set your preferred color scheme as dark Storybook will use the light theme as default.

As an example, you can tell Storybook to use the "dark" theme by modifying `.storybook/manager.js`:

```js
import { addons } from '@storybook/addons';
import { themes } from '@storybook/theming';

addons.setConfig({
  theme: themes.dark,
});

```

When setting a theme, set a full theme object. The theme is replaced, not combined.

Read on for more on how to create your own theme.

## Create a theme quickstart

The easiest way to customize Storybook is to generate a new theme using the `create()` function from `storybook/theming`. This function includes shorthands for the most common theme variables. Here's how to use it:

First create a new file in `.storybook` called `yourTheme.js`.

Next paste the code below and tweak the variables.

```ts
import { create } from '@storybook/theming/create';

export default create({
  base: 'light',

  colorPrimary: 'hotpink',
  colorSecondary: 'deepskyblue',

  // UI
  appBg: 'white',
  appContentBg: 'silver',
  appBorderColor: 'grey',
  appBorderRadius: 4,

  // Typography
  fontBase: '"Open Sans", sans-serif',
  fontCode: 'monospace',

  // Text colors
  textColor: 'black',
  textInverseColor: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.9)',

  // Toolbar default and active colors
  barTextColor: 'silver',
  barSelectedColor: 'black',
  barBg: 'hotpink',

  // Form colors
  inputBg: 'white',
  inputBorder: 'silver',
  inputTextColor: 'black',
  inputBorderRadius: 4,

  brandTitle: 'My custom storybook',
  brandUrl: 'https://example.com',
  brandImage: 'https://placehold.it/350x150',
});
```

Finally, import your theme into `.storybook/manager.js` and add it to your Storybook parameters.

```js
import { addons } from '@storybook/addons';
import yourTheme from './yourTheme';

addons.setConfig({
  theme: yourTheme,
});
```

The `storybook/theming` package is built using TypeScript, so this should help create a valid theme for typescript users. The types are part of the package itself.

Many theme variables are optional, the `base` property is NOT. This is a perfectly valid theme:

```ts
import { create } from '@storybook/theming/create';

export default create({
  base: 'light',

  brandTitle: 'My custom storybook',
  brandUrl: 'https://example.com',
  brandImage: 'https://placehold.it/350x150',
});
```

## Addons and theme creation

Some addons require specific theme variables that a Storybook user must add. If you share your theme with the community, make sure to support the official and other popular addons so your users have a consistent experience.

For example, the popular Actions addon uses [react-inspector](https://github.com/xyc/react-inspector/blob/master/src/styles/themes/chromeLight.js) which has themes of its own. Supply additional theme variables to style it like so:

```js
addonActionsTheme: {
  ...chromeLight,
  BASE_FONT_FAMILY: typography.fonts.mono,
  BASE_BACKGROUND_COLOR: 'transparent',
}
```

### Using the theme for addon authors

For a native Storybook experience, we encourage addon authors to reuse the theme variables above. The theming engine relies on [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), a CSS-in-JS library.

```js
import { styled } from '@storybook/theming';
```

Use the theme variables in object notation:

```js
const Component = styled.div(({ theme }) => ({
  background: theme.background.app,
  width: 0,
}));
```

Or with template literals:

```js
const Component = styled.div`
  background: `${props => props.theme.background.app}`
  width: 0;
`;
```
